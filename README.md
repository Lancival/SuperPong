## Inpirations
We were inspired by Pong, but felt that the game could be improved to include more interesting mechanics. 

## How We Built Super Pong
We built Super Pong using Unity, and made our own graphics with GIMP and Sketchpad. We also used the Azonix font.

## What It Does
In Super Pong, two players compete to reach 20 points first by slipping a pong ball past their opponents paddle. However, powerdowns that introduce more balls, speed up the game, and even change the size of paddles interfere with both players' ability to play!

## Challenges
We had limited experience with Unity and programming in C# to begin with, but with the power of the internet, we were able to expand our skillsets. In particular, programming the time-slowing powerup was especially challenging because of the complexities of Unity's time-related mechanics. Getting audio to work was also challenging due to out-of-date guides and documentation for deprecated methods.

## Accomplishments
We made Pong more fun!
